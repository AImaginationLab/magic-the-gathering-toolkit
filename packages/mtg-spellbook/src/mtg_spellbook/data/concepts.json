When all players pass in succession with nothing on the stack, the phase ends\n4.

One blocker can only block one attacker, but multiple blockers can block the same attacker.\n\n4. Combat Damage - Damage is dealt simultaneously (except first strike). Attacking creature deals damage to blockers; unblocked creatures deal damage to the defending player/planeswalker.\n\n5. End of Combat - Cleanup phase for combat\n\nKey points:\n- Blocked creatures deal damage to blockers, not the player (even if blocker dies before damage)\n- First strike creatures deal damage in a separate, earlier step\n- Trample lets excess damage 'spill over' to the player",
